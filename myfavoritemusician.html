  <p> 
      <ol>Shakira is a Colombian singer. She is well known for her songs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUT5rEU6pqM">Hips don't lie</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT8xMunS608">La La La (Waka waka)</a></ol>
  <br>
  <ol>Shakira is married to Spanish soccer player Pique, and they have two sons: Milan and Sasha.</ol>
<br>
<ol>My favorite songs from Shakira are:</ol>
<ul>Sale el Sol</ul>
<ul>Gitana</ul>
<ul>Antologia</ul>
<br>
You may not recognize these songs. That's because I like her old songs and sound better.
