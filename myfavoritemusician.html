  <p> 
  Shakira is a Colombian singer. She is well known for her songs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUT5rEU6pqM">Hips don't lie</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT8xMunS608">La La La (Waka waka)</a>
  <br>
  Shakira is married to Spanish soccer player Pique, and they have two sons: Milan and Sasha.
<br>
My favorite songs from Shakira are:
<ol start="1">
  <li>Sale el Sol </li>
<li>Gitana</li>
<li>Antologia</li>
</ol>
<br>
You may not recognize these songs. That's because I like her old songs better than the new. My opinion is shared by most Colombians.
<br>
<h2>2. Maroon Five</h2>
