    <h2>Obi and Vader</h2>
    <img class="obi" src="images/obi.jpg" alt="obi">
    <p>Obi is an orange Tabby. He was born in April 2020 and I adopted him on May 24 for my birthday. Obi loves to eat. His favorite food is raw food and all the snacks. He also likes to much on my plants, but we're trying to correct that</p>

    <p>Vader is a black kitten. I like to say he is a black tabby because he has stripes on his fur. He is the sweetest boy and enjoys bird-watching. He also loves raw food. His favorite snacks are freeze-dried chicken and lick tubes. He is a very adventurous and brave kitten</p>
